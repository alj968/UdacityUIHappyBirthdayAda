# Happy Birthday Ada Lovelace!

Simple one-page app representing a greeting card to the first female programmer, Ada Lovelace. It uses a relative layout, 3 TextViews, 2 ImageViews and stores strings and styles in the values folder. I also used it as a chance to try out the rounded imageview technique I learned about on the "fragmented" podcast.
